## Goals

- Provide a beginner friendly development environment
- Use the latest iOS development tools
- Document everything! Helps beginners learn :)
- Build an awesome open source Reddit client for iOS!

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Make sure you have Xcode: 10.2 or higher.

This project currently supports Swift 5.0+

### Setup

Clone the repo and run the generate command:
```console
git clone git@github.com:kgellci/Area51.git
cd Area51/
make generate
```

After `generate` is finished doing its job, open Area51.xcodeproj, build and run.

### Project Structure

Area51 does not import any 3rd party libraries in app.

[Xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) is used for project definition and generation.

[Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) is used to keep the code properly structured and readable.

[Learn more about the project structure.](docs/project.md)

### Running on a device
Make sure you run `make generate` command from above to generate the appropriate config files.

Edit the `user.xcconfig` file in the `Configs/` directory (don't worry, it is gitignored!).
Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in the user.xcconfig file. Example:
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = XXXXXXXXX`

Edit the `bundleIdentifier.xcconfig` file in `Configs/` directory (also gitignored!).
Set `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` in bundleIdentifier.xcconfig to something unique, Example:
`PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = whatever.i.want`

You will need to close the Xcode project, run `make generate` and open the project again.
You can find your team ID by logging into [developer.apple.com](developer.apple.com).
